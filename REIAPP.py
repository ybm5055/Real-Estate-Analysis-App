    ## Overview: ##
    ---------------------
    This App was created because the author was bored of using his excel model for a real estate deal analysis one day, and decided to spend hours on creating an app with streamlit for the first time instead :upside_down_face:\n
    He did think it was a fun experience and streamlit is pretty cool.\n
    If you are a real estate investor and want to take a break from the spreadsheets, feel free to use this for a simple and quick analysis on the COC return and Cap Rate by entering the variables below :point_down:\n
